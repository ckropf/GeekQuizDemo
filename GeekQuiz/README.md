# GeekQuizDemo

GeekQuizDemo is a training application initially created by following the asp.net training lab at [http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/getting-started-with-aspnet-web-api/build-a-single-page-application-%28spa%29-with-aspnet-web-api-and-angularjs](http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/getting-started-with-aspnet-web-api/build-a-single-page-application-%28spa%29-with-aspnet-web-api-and-angularjs).

I intend to use this application as a platform to improve my competence with:

1. ASP.NET MVC
2. ASP.NET WebApi
3. Microsoft Entity Framework
4. AngularJs

## Dependencies
This application utilizes [NuGet Package Restore](https://docs.nuget.org/consume/package-restore) for 'packages' dependencies and SQL Server for data persistance (it has been modified away from localdb as was originally configured in the asp.net demo).

## Future changes
I plan to continue to modify this project to suit future training needs as they arise and as such I cannot foresee the future direction of the project.
